Bot
===

This is fork from generic client bot for Matrix which supports plugins.
It appeared because I'm sad to see that NEB is obsoleted by go-neb `Issue#21 <https://github.com/matrix-org/Matrix-NEB/issues/21>`_
This bot can speak on users's language (if there is a corresponding localization.
About preparing localization read in `LOCALE.rst <https://github.com/slipeer/Matrix-NEB/blob/master/LOCALE.rst>`_)
